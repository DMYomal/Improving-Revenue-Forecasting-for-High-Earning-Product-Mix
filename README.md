Abstract
In the dynamic landscape of 21st-century e-commerce, where consumer behaviors evolve rapidly, 
strategic foresight into future cash flows is imperative for business success. This research employs 
publicly available data from Olist to forecast revenue trends within a defined timeframe. 
Leveraging feature engineering and sentiment analysis (VARDER), the study delves into the 
impact of customer reviews on sales revenue. Employing a multifaceted approach, the forecasting 
techniques encompass traditional forecasting approaches such as Simple Moving Average(SMA), 
univariate time series analysis(ARIMA), multivariate time series analysis(VAR Model), and five
machine learning regression models such as Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random 
Forest, XGBoost, and AdaBoost. This comprehensive methodology aims to refine revenue 
forecasting for high-earning product mixes, providing valuable insights for strategic decisionmaking in the competitive e-commerce landscape.
